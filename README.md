### Introduction
I'm researching the impact of El Nino on Japanese temperature anomalies especially now. As you can see in the picture, El Ninos are not a regular phenomenon, but appear once in every two to seven years. During El Nino, Japanese winters are noted to be warmer than usual with less snowfall. However, this relationship is not stable during El Nino years. For example, during the very strong El Nino of 1997/1998 Japanese climate was not affected as in other milder El Nino years. On the other hand, the 2015 El Nino had a strong effect on Japanese climate.<br><br>

### Approach
From above time series, 11 El Nino years (1965, 1968, 1969, 1976, 1986, 1987, 1991, 2002, 2004, 2009, 2015) were identified. Thereafter, composite monthly maps of surface temperature anomalies over Japan were constructed starting from January and ending in May of the next year. This period covers the initiation of a typical El Nino and continues into the spring following its termination.<br><br>
To understand, how the time evolution of Japanese surface temperature anomalies during El Nino varies according to geography, we classified the composite time series using the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm.<br>
###### Current Status<br>I've finished data analysis until 2004 and now try to collect data of 2009 and 2015 from JMA.<br>
